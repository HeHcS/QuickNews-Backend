# Authentication System Test Summary

## Components Tested

The authentication system has been tested to confirm it properly implements:

1. **User Model** - The Mongoose schema with password hashing
2. **JWT Functionality** - Token generation and verification
3. **Password Reset Flow** - Token generation and verification
4. **Password Security** - Bcrypt hashing and comparison

## Test Results

All tests passed, confirming that:

- JWT access tokens are correctly generated and contain the user ID
- JWT refresh tokens are correctly generated and can be verified
- Invalid tokens are properly rejected
- Password reset tokens are correctly generated and can be hashed/verified
- Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt
- Correct passwords are properly verified
- Incorrect passwords are properly rejected

## Authentication System Features

The implemented authentication system includes:

1. **User Registration** - Create new users with secure password storage
2. **User Login** - Authenticate users and generate JWT tokens
3. **Token Refresh** - Allow users to get new access tokens without re-authentication
4. **Password Reset** - Secure flow for resetting forgotten passwords
5. **OAuth Integration** - Support for Google authentication
6. **Role-Based Access Control** - User, creator, and admin roles
7. **Account Verification** - Support for email verification (to be implemented)

## API Endpoints

The authentication system exposes these endpoints:

- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new users
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate and get tokens
- `POST /api/auth/refresh-token` - Get a new access token
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Initiate password reset
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password/:token` - Complete password reset
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user profile
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout user
- `GET /api/auth/google` - Google OAuth login
- `GET /api/auth/google/callback` - Google OAuth callback

## Security Features

The authentication system implements these security features:

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT with expiration for access tokens
- Separate refresh tokens with longer expiration
- Secure password reset flow with token hashing
- Input validation with express-validator
- Rate limiting protection (implementation needed)
- HTTPS support (configuration needed)

## Next Steps

The following enhancements could be implemented:

1. Email verification for new accounts
2. Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
3. Two-factor authentication
4. Apple OAuth integration
5. Session management and device tracking
6. Account lockout after failed attempts
